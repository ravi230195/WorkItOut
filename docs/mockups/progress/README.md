# Progress Screen Option B Notes

The Progress screen now renders KPI trends with the **Option B** treatment that we explored earlier. Instead of line graphs, each timeframe (weekly, three-month, and six-month) is rendered as a warm, KPI-colored bar chart that mirrors the WorkItOut light theme.

### Key traits implemented in the product

- **Warm ivory canvas**: the trend card uses a soft gradient background and subtle border to sit naturally inside the rest of the app shell.
- **KPI-matched color**: the active KPI chip and every bar share the same color token so users can immediately connect the selected metric to its visual representation.
- **Calibrated spacing**: consistent gutters, rounded bar caps, and faint horizontal grid lines keep the layout tidy and easy to scan across all ranges.
- **Contextual hover states**: hovering or focusing a bar reveals an anchored tooltip, average guide line, and a highlighted stroke for quick comparisons.

These notes remain for context only; the earlier SVG and PNG exploration assets have been removed now that the design has been coded directly into the Progress screen.
